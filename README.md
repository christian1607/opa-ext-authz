# opa-ext-authz

Within this repo are various examples of OPA providing external authorization for HTTP based applications and microservices.

All examples are inspired by, and derivative of, the official OPA docs - specifically:
* [HTTP API Authorization with OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/http-api-authorization/)
* [Envoy Authorization with OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/envoy-authorization/)
